Tenant Rent Management  
Tenant Rent Management is a full-stack application designed to manage tenant information and rent payments. This application consists of a backend service developed in Java Spring Boot and a frontend client developed using React. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and view tenants and their rent payments seamlessly.

Here’s how you can access my Tenant Rent Management application:        
1. Access the Backend: Navigate to https://51.20.252.82:8443/api/login.        
2. Trust the Certificate: Click "Advanced" and then "Proceed to 51.20.252.82 (unsafe)" to trust the local keystore certificate.        
3. Use the Frontend: Head over to https://tenant-rental-app.netlify.app/         
to start using the application through the frontend.        
    
And that's it! You’re all set to explore the features of my application. 🚀
